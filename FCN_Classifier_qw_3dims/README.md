An FCN based classifier to classify between the activities - walking and queuing. 
The time series for walking and queuing are similar so it is challenging to build a classifier for them.
This model uses only accelerometer sensor values. Compare the results with the [same model](./../FCN_Classifier_qw_allDims) that uses data from all sensors.
